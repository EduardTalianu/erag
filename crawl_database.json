Born in the Republic of Florence , his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art . Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man , along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci . [3] Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era. [4] [5] Michelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the Piet\u00e0 and David , were sculpted before the age of 30. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture . [6] At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica . Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death. Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. [3] Three biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari , proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was \"supreme in not one art alone but in all three.\" [7] In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino (\"the divine one\"). [8] His contemporaries admired his terribilit\u00e0 \u2014his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate [9] the expressive physicality of Michelangelo's style contributed to the rise of Mannerism , a short-lived movement in Western art between the High Renaissance and the Baroque . Life Early life, 1475\u20131488 Michelangelo was born on 6 March 1475 [a] in Caprese , known today as Caprese Michelangelo, a small town situated in Valtiberina, [10] near Arezzo , Tuscany . [11] For several generations, his family had been small-scale bankers in Florence ; but the bank failed, and his father, Ludovico di Leonardo Buonarroti Simoni, briefly took a government post in Caprese, where Michelangelo was born. [3] At the time of Michelangelo's birth, his father was the town's judicial administrator and podest\u00e0 or local administrator of Chiusi della Verna . Michelangelo's mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena. [12] The Buonarrotis claimed to descend from the Countess Matilde di Canossa \u2014a claim that remains unproven, but which Michelangelo believed. [13] Several months after Michelangelo's birth, the family returned to Florence, where he was raised. During his mother's later prolonged illness, and after her death in 1481 (when he was six years old), Michelangelo lived with a nanny and her husband, a stonecutter, in the town of Settignano , where his father owned a marble quarry and a small farm. [12] There he gained his love for marble. As Giorgio Vasari quotes him: If there is some good in me, it is because I was born in the subtle atmosphere of your country of Arezzo. Along with the milk of my nurse I received the knack of handling chisel and hammer, with which I make my figures. [11] Apprenticeships, 1488\u20131492 The Madonna of the Stairs (1490\u20131492), Michelangelo's earliest known work in marble As a young boy, Michelangelo was sent to Florence to study grammar under the Humanist Francesco da Urbino. [11] [14] [b] He showed no interest in his schooling, preferring to copy paintings from churches and seek the company of other painters. [14] The city of Florence was at that time Italy's greatest centre of the arts and learning. [15] Art was sponsored by the Signoria (the town council), the merchant guilds, and wealthy patrons such as the Medici and their banking associates. [16] The Renaissance , a renewal of Classical scholarship and the arts, had its first flowering in Florence. [15] In the early 15th century, the architect Filippo Brunelleschi , having studied the remains of Classical buildings in Rome, had created two churches, San Lorenzo's and Santo Spirito , which embodied the Classical precepts. [17] The sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti had laboured for fifty years to create the north and east bronze doors of the Baptistry , which Michelangelo was to describe as \"The Gates of Paradise\". [18] The exterior niches of the Church of Orsanmichele contained a gallery of works by the most acclaimed sculptors of Florence: Donatello , Ghiberti, Andrea del Verrocchio , and Nanni di Banco . [16] The interiors of the older churches were covered with frescos (mostly in Late Medieval, but also in the Early Renaissance style), begun by Giotto and continued by Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel , both of whose works Michelangelo studied and copied in drawings. [19] During Michelangelo's childhood, a team of painters had been called from Florence to the Vatican to decorate the walls of the Sistine Chapel . Among them was Domenico Ghirlandaio , a master in fresco painting, perspective, figure drawing and portraiture who had the largest workshop in Florence. [16] In 1488, at age 13, Michelangelo was apprenticed to Ghirlandaio. [20] The next year, his father persuaded Ghirlandaio to pay Michelangelo as an artist, which was rare for someone of fourteen. [21] When in 1489, Lorenzo de' Medici , de facto ruler of Florence, asked Ghirlandaio for his two best pupils, Ghirlandaio sent Michelangelo and Francesco Granacci . [22] From 1490 to 1492, Michelangelo attended the Platonic Academy , a Humanist academy founded by the Medici. There, his work and outlook were influenced by many of the most prominent philosophers and writers of the day, including Marsilio Ficino , Pico della Mirandola and Poliziano . [23] At this time, Michelangelo sculpted the reliefs Madonna of the Stairs (1490\u20131492) and Battle of the Centaurs (1491\u20131492), [19] the latter based on a theme suggested by Poliziano and commissioned by Lorenzo de' Medici. [24] Michelangelo worked for a time with the sculptor Bertoldo di Giovanni . When he was seventeen, another pupil, Pietro Torrigiano , struck him on the nose, causing the disfigurement that is conspicuous in the portraits of Michelangelo. [25] Bologna, Florence, and Rome, 1492\u20131499 Piet\u00e0 , St Peter's Basilica (1498\u20131499) Lorenzo de' Medici's death on 8 April 1492 brought a reversal of Michelangelo's circumstances. [26] Michelangelo left the security of the Medici court and returned to his father's house. In the following months he carved a polychrome wooden Crucifix (1493), as a gift to the prior of the Florentine church of Santo Spirito, which had allowed him to do some anatomical studies of the corpses from the church's hospital. [27] This was the first of several instances during his career that Michelangelo studied anatomy by dissecting cadavers. [28] [29] Between 1493 and 1494, he bought a block of marble, and carved a larger-than-life statue of Hercules , which was sent to France and subsequently disappeared sometime in the 18th century. [24] [c] On 20 January 1494, after heavy snowfalls, Lorenzo's heir, Piero de Medici , commissioned a statue made of snow, and Michelangelo again entered the court of the Medici. [30] In the same year, the Medici were expelled from Florence as the result of the rise of Savonarola . Michelangelo left the city before the end of the political upheaval, moving to Venice and then to Bologna . [26] In Bologna, he was commissioned to carve several of the last small figures for the completion of the Shrine of St. Dominic , in the church dedicated to that saint. At this time Michelangelo studied the robust reliefs carved by Jacopo della Quercia around the main portal of the Basilica of St Petronius , including the panel of The Creation of Eve , the composition of which was to reappear on the Sistine Chapel ceiling . [31] Towards the end of 1495, the political situation in Florence was calmer; the city, previously under threat from the French, was no longer in danger as Charles VIII had suffered defeats. Michelangelo returned to Florence but received no commissions from the new city government under Savonarola. [32] He returned to the employment of the Medici. [33] During the half-year he spent in Florence, he worked on two small statues, a child St. John the Baptist and a sleeping Cupid . According to Condivi, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici , for whom Michelangelo had sculpted St. John the Baptist , asked that Michelangelo \"fix it so that it looked as if it had been buried\" so he could \"send it to Rome\u00a0... pass [it off as] an ancient work and\u00a0... sell it much better.\" Both Lorenzo and Michelangelo were unwittingly cheated out of the real value of the piece by a middleman. Cardinal Raffaele Riario , to whom Lorenzo had sold it, discovered that it was a fraud, but was so impressed by the quality of the sculpture that he invited the artist to Rome. [34] [d] This apparent success in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative Florentine situation may have encouraged Michelangelo to accept the prelate's invitation. [33] Michelangelo arrived in Rome on 25 June 1496 [35] at the age of 21. On 4 July of the same year, he began work on a commission for Cardinal Riario, an over-life-size statue of the Roman wine god Bacchus . Upon completion, the work was rejected by the cardinal, and subsequently entered the collection of the banker Jacopo Galli, for his garden. [36] [37] In November 1497, the French ambassador to the Holy See, Cardinal Jean de Bilh\u00e8res-Lagraulas , commissioned him to carve a Piet\u00e0 , a sculpture showing the Virgin Mary grieving over the body of Jesus. The subject, which is not part of the Biblical narrative of the Crucifixion, was common in religious sculpture of medieval northern Europe and would have been very familiar to the Cardinal. [38] The contract was agreed upon in August of the following year. Michelangelo was 24 at the time of its completion. [38] It was soon to be regarded as one of the world's great masterpieces of sculpture, \"a revelation of all the potentialities and force of the art of sculpture\". Contemporary opinion was summarised by Vasari: \"It is certainly a miracle that a formless block of stone could ever have been reduced to a perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh.\" [39] It is now located in St Peter's Basilica . Florence, 1499\u20131505 Main article: David (Michelangelo) David , completed by Michelangelo in 1504, is one of the most renowned works of the Renaissance. Michelangelo returned to Florence in 1499. The Republic was changing after the fall of its leader, anti-Renaissance priest Girolamo Savonarola , who was executed in 1498, and the rise of the gonfaloniere Piero Soderini . Michelangelo was asked by the consuls of the Guild of Wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by Agostino di Duccio : a colossal statue of Carrara marble portraying David as a symbol of Florentine freedom to be placed on the gable of Florence Cathedral . [40] Michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work, the statue of David , in 1504. The masterwork definitively established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination. A team of consultants, including Botticelli , Leonardo da Vinci , Filippino Lippi , Pietro Perugino , Lorenzo di Credi , Antonio and Giuliano da Sangallo , Andrea della Robbia , Cosimo Rosselli , Davide Ghirlandaio , Piero di Cosimo , Andrea Sansovino and Michelangelo's dear friend Francesco Granacci , was called together to decide upon its placement, ultimately the Piazza della Signoria, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio . It now stands in the Academia while a replica occupies its place in the square. [41] In the same period of placing the David , Michelangelo may have been involved in creating the sculptural profile on Palazzo Vecchio's fa\u00e7ade known as the Importuno di Michelangelo . The hypothesis [42] of Michelangelo's possible involvement in the creation of the profile is based on the strong resemblance of the latter to a profile drawn by the artist, datable to the beginning of the 16th century, now preserved in the Louvre . [43] With the completion of the David came another commission. In early 1504 Leonardo da Vinci had been commissioned to paint The Battle of Anghiari in the council chamber of the Palazzo Vecchio, depicting the battle between Florence and Milan in 1440. Michelangelo was then commissioned to paint the Battle of Cascina . The two paintings are very different: Leonardo depicts soldiers fighting on horseback, while Michelangelo has soldiers being ambushed as they bathe in the river. Neither work was completed and both were lost forever when the chamber was refurbished. Both works were much admired, and copies remain of them, Leonardo's work having been copied by Rubens and Michelangelo's by Bastiano da Sangallo . [44] Also during this period, Michelangelo was commissioned by Angelo Doni to paint a \" Holy Family \" as a present for his wife, Maddalena Strozzi. It is known as the Doni Tondo and hangs in the Uffizi Gallery in its original magnificent frame, which Michelangelo may have designed. [45] [46] He also may have painted the Madonna and Child with John the Baptist , known as the Manchester Madonna and now in the National Gallery , London. [47] Tomb of Julius II, 1505\u20131545 Main article: Tomb of Pope Julius II Michelangelo's second design for the monument of Pope Julius II In 1505 Michelangelo was invited back to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II and commissioned to build the Pope's tomb , [2] which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years. [48] Under the patronage of the pope, Michelangelo experienced constant interruptions to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks. The commission for the tomb forced the artist to leave Florence with his planned Battle of Cascina painting unfinished. [49] [50] [51] By this time, Michelangelo was established as an artist; [52] both he and Julius II had hot tempers and soon argued. [50] [51] On 17 April 1506, Michelangelo left Rome in secret for Florence, remaining there until the Florentine government pressed him to return to the pope. [51] Although Michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years, it was never finished to his satisfaction. [48] It is located in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome and is most famous for the central figure of Moses , completed in 1516. [53] Of the other statues intended for the tomb, two, known as the Rebellious Slave and the Dying Slave , are now in the Louvre . [48] Sistine Chapel ceiling, 1508 \u20131512 Main article: Sistine Chapel ceiling Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ; the work took approximately four years to complete (1508\u20131512). During the same period, Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, [54] which took approximately four years to complete (1508\u20131512). [53] According to Condivi's account, Bramante , who was working on the building of St. Peter's Basilica , resented Michelangelo's commission for the pope's tomb and convinced the pope to commission him in a medium with which he was unfamiliar, in order that he might fail at the task. [55] Michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the Twelve Apostles on the triangular pendentives that supported the ceiling, and to cover the central part of the ceiling with ornament. [56] Michelangelo persuaded Pope Julius II to give him a free hand and proposed a different and more complex scheme, [50] [51] representing the Creation , the Fall of Man , the Promise of Salvation through the prophets, and the genealogy of Christ . The work is part of a larger scheme of decoration within the chapel that represents much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church. [56] The composition stretches over 500 square metres of ceiling [57] and contains over 300 figures. [56] At its centre are nine episodes from the Book of Genesis , divided into three groups: God's creation of the earth; God's creation of humankind and their fall from God's grace; and lastly, the state of humanity as represented by Noah and his family. On the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of Jesus, seven prophets of Israel, and five Sibyls , prophetic women of the Classical world. [56] Among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are The Creation of Adam , [58] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden , the Deluge , the Prophet Jeremiah , and the Cumaean Sibyl . Florence under Medici popes, 1513 \u2013 early 1534 In 1513, Pope Julius II died and was succeeded by Pope Leo X , the second son of Lorenzo de' Medici. [53] From 1513 to 1516, Pope Leo was on good terms with Pope Julius's surviving relatives, so encouraged Michelangelo to continue work on Julius's tomb, but the families became enemies again in 1516 when Pope Leo tried to seize the Duchy of Urbino from Julius's nephew Francesco Maria I della Rovere . [59] Pope Leo then had Michelangelo stop working on the tomb, and commissioned him to reconstruct the fa\u00e7ade of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence and to adorn it with sculptures. He spent three years creating drawings and models for the fa\u00e7ade, as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at Pietrasanta specifically for the project. In 1520, the work was abruptly cancelled by his financially strapped patrons before any real progress had been made. The basilica lacks a fa\u00e7ade to this day. [60] In 1520, the Medici came back to Michelangelo with another grand proposal, this time for a family funerary chapel in the Basilica of San Lorenzo. [53] For posterity, this project, occupying the artist for much of the 1520s and 1530s, was more fully realised. Michelangelo used his own discretion to create the composition of the Medici Chapel , which houses the large tombs of two of the younger members of the Medici family, Giuliano, Duke of Nemours , and Lorenzo, his nephew. It also serves to commemorate their more famous predecessors, Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano, who are buried nearby. The tombs display statues of the two Medici and allegorical figures representing Night and Day , and Dusk and Dawn . The chapel also contains Michelangelo's Medici Madonna . [61] In 1976, a concealed corridor was discovered with drawings on the walls that related to the chapel itself. [62] [63] Pope Leo X died in 1521 and was succeeded briefly by the austere Adrian VI , and then by his cousin Giulio Medici as Pope Clement VII . [64] In 1524, Michelangelo received an architectural commission from the Medici pope for the Laurentian Library at San Lorenzo's Church. [53] He designed both the interior of the library itself and its vestibule, a building utilising architectural forms with such dynamic effect that it is seen as the forerunner of Baroque architecture . It was left to assistants to interpret his plans and carry out construction. The library was not opened until 1571, and the vestibule remained incomplete until 1904. [65] In 1527, Florentine citizens, encouraged by the sack of Rome , threw out the Medici and restored the republic. A siege of the city ensued, and Michelangelo went to the aid of his beloved Florence by working on the city's fortifications from 1528 to 1529. The city fell in 1530, and the Medici were restored to power, [53] with the young Alessandro Medici as the first Duke of Florence. Pope Clement, a Medici, sentenced Michelangelo to death. It is thought that Michelangelo hid for two months in a small chamber under the Medici chapels in the Basilica of San Lorenzo with light from just a tiny window, making many charcoal and chalk drawings which remained hidden until the room was rediscovered in 1975, and opened to small numbers of visitors in 2023. Michelangelo was eventually pardoned by the Medicis and the death sentence lifted, so that he could complete work on the Sistine Chapel and the Medici family tomb. He left Florence for Rome in 1534. [66] Despite Michelangelo's support of the republic and resistance to the Medici rule, Pope Clement reinstated an allowance that he had previously granted the artist and made a new contract with him over the tomb of Pope Julius. [67] Rome, 1534\u20131546 The Last Judgment (1534\u20131541) In Rome, Michelangelo lived near the church of Santa Maria di Loreto . It was at this time that he met the poet Vittoria Colonna , marchioness of Pescara , who was to become one of his closest friends until her death in 1547. [68] Shortly before his death in 1534, Pope Clement VII commissioned Michelangelo to paint a fresco of The Last Judgment on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. His successor, Pope Paul III , was instrumental in seeing that Michelangelo began and completed the project, which he laboured on from 1534 to October 1541. [53] The fresco depicts the Second Coming of Christ and his Judgement of the souls. Michelangelo ignored the usual artistic conventions in portraying Jesus, showing him as a massive, muscular figure, youthful, beardless and naked. [69] He is surrounded by saints, among whom Saint Bartholomew holds a drooping flayed skin, bearing the likeness of Michelangelo. The dead rise from their graves, to be consigned either to Heaven or to Hell. [69] Once completed, the depiction of Christ and the Virgin Mary naked was considered sacrilegious, and Cardinal Carafa and Monsignor Sernini ( Mantua 's ambassador) campaigned to have the fresco removed or censored, but the Pope resisted. At the Council of Trent , shortly before Michelangelo's death in 1564, it was decided to obscure the genitals and Daniele da Volterra , an apprentice of Michelangelo, was commissioned to make the alterations. [70] An uncensored copy of the original, by Marcello Venusti , is in the Capodimonte Museum of Naples . [71] Michelangelo worked on a number of architectural projects at this time. They included a design for the Capitoline Hill with its trapezoid piazza displaying the ancient bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius . He designed the upper floor of the Palazzo Farnese and the interior of the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli , in which he transformed the vaulted interior of an Ancient Roman bathhouse. Other architectural works include San Giovanni dei Fiorentini , the Sforza Chapel (Capella Sforza) in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore and the Porta Pia . [72] St Peter's Basilica, 1546\u20131564 Main article: St Peter's Basilica \u00a7\u00a0Architecture The dome of St Peter's Basilica While still working on the Last Judgment , Michelangelo received yet another commission for the Vatican. This was for the painting of two large frescos in the Cappella Paolina depicting significant events in the lives of the two most important saints of Rome, the Conversion of Saint Paul and the Crucifixion of Saint Peter . Like the Last Judgment , these two works are complex compositions containing a great number of figures. [73] They were completed in 1550. In the same year, Giorgio Vasari published his Vita , including a biography of Michelangelo. [74] In 1546, Michelangelo was appointed architect of St. Peter's Basilica , Rome. [53] The process of replacing the Constantinian basilica of the 4th century had been underway for fifty years and in 1506 foundations had been laid to the plans of Bramante. Successive architects had worked on it, but little progress had been made. Michelangelo was persuaded to take over the project. He returned to the concepts of Bramante, and developed his ideas for a centrally planned church, strengthening the structure both physically and visually. [75] The dome, not completed until after his death, has been called by Banister Fletcher , \"the greatest creation of the Renaissance\". [76] As construction was progressing on St Peter's, there was concern that Michelangelo would die before the dome was finished. However, once building commenced on the lower part of the dome, the supporting ring, the completion of the design was inevitable. On 7 December 2007, a red chalk sketch for the dome of St Peter's Basilica, possibly the last made by Michelangelo before his death, was discovered in the Vatican archives. It is extremely rare, since he destroyed his designs later in life. The sketch is a partial plan for one of the radial columns of the cupola drum of St Peter's. [77] Personal life Ignudo fresco from 1509 on the Sistine Chapel ceiling Speculation exists that this may be a drawing by Michelangelo that might portray Tommaso dei Cavalieri [78] [79] Faith Michelangelo was a devout Catholic whose faith deepened at the end of his life. [80] Along with Raphael, he was enrolled in the Secular Franciscan Order . [81] [ better\u00a0source\u00a0needed ] His poetry includes the following closing lines from what is known as poem 285 (written in 1554): \"Neither painting nor sculpture will be able any longer to calm my soul, now turned toward that divine love that opened his arms on the cross to take us in.\" [82] [83] Personal habits Michelangelo was abstemious in his personal life, and once told his apprentice, Ascanio Condivi : \"However rich I may have been, I have always lived like a poor man.\" [84] Michelangelo's bank accounts and numerous deeds of purchase show that his net worth was about 50,000 gold ducats , more than many princes and dukes of his time. [85] Condivi said he was indifferent to food and drink, eating \"more out of necessity than of pleasure\" [84] and that he \"often slept in his clothes and\u00a0... boots.\" [84] His biographer Paolo Giovio says, \"His nature was so rough and uncouth that his domestic habits were incredibly squalid, and deprived posterity of any pupils who might have followed him.\" [86] This, however, may not have affected him, as he was by nature a solitary and melancholy person, bizzarro e fantastico , a man who \"withdrew himself from the company of men.\" [87] Relationships and poetry Love for a lady's different. Not much in that for a wise and virile lover's trouble. \u2014 translation of Michelangelo work by John Frederick Nim It is impossible to know whether Michelangelo had any physical relationships. [88] Understanding about his sexuality is rooted in his art, especially his poetry. [89] He wrote more than three hundred sonnets and madrigals . About sixty are addressed to men \u2014 \"the first significant modern corpus of love poetry from one man to another\". [90] The longest sequence, displaying deep loving feeling, was written to the young Roman patrician Tommaso dei Cavalieri ( c. 1509\u20131587 ), who was 23 years old when Michelangelo first met him in 1532, at the age of 57. [91] [92] In his Lives of the Artists , Giorgio Vasari observed: \"But infinitely more than any of the others he loved M. Tommaso de' Cavalieri, a Roman gentleman, for whom, being a young man and much inclined to these arts, [Michelangelo] made, to the end that he might learn to draw, many most superb drawings of divinely beautiful heads, designed in black and red chalk; and then he drew for him a Ganymede rapt to Heaven by Jove's Eagle, a Tityus with the Vulture devouring his heart, the Chariot of the Sun falling with Pha\u00ebthon into the Po, and a Bacchanal of children, which are all in themselves most rare things, and drawings the like of which have never been seen.\" [93] Some scholars downplay the relationship between Michelangelo and Cavalieri as one of platonic friendship. [94] The poems to Cavalieri make up the first large sequence of poems in any modern tongue addressed by one man to another; they predate by 50 years Shakespeare 's sonnets to the fair youth: I feel as lit by fire a cold countenance That burns me from afar and keeps itself ice-chill; A strength I feel two shapely arms to fill Which without motion moves every balance. \u2014 translation of Michelangelo work by Michael Sullivan Cavalieri replied: \"I swear to return your love. Never have I loved a man more than I love you, never have I wished for a friendship more than I wish for yours.\" Cavalieri remained devoted to Michelangelo until his death. [95] In 1542, Michelangelo met Cecchino dei Bracci who died only a year later, inspiring Michelangelo to write 48 funeral epigrams . Some of the objects of Michelangelo's affections, and subjects of his poetry, took advantage of him: the model Febo di Poggio asked for money in response to a love-poem, and a second model, Gherardo Perini , shamelessly stole from him. [95] The nature of the poetry has been a source of discomfort to later generations. Michelangelo's grandnephew, Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger , published the poems in 1623 with the gender of pronouns changed; he also removed words or in other instances insisted that Michelangelo's poems be read allegorically and philosophically, [96] [90] a judgment some modern scholars still repeat today. [95] It was not until John Addington Symonds translated the poems into English in 1893 that the original genders were restored. Since then it has become more accepted that his poems should be understood at face value, that is, as indicating his personal feelings and a preference by him for young men over women. [97] Late in life, Michelangelo nurtured a friendship with the poet and noble widow Vittoria Colonna , whom he met in Rome in 1536 or 1538 and who was in her late forties at the time. They wrote sonnets for each other and were in regular contact until she died. These sonnets mostly deal with the spiritual issues that occupied them. [98] Condivi, who in his biography was preoccupied with downplaying Michelangelo's attraction to men, [90] alleged Michelangelo said his sole regret in life was that he did not kiss the widow's face in the same manner that he had her hand. [68] Feuds with other artists In a letter from late 1542, Michelangelo blamed the tensions between Julius\u00a0II and him on the envy of Bramante and Raphael , saying of the latter, \"all he had in art, he got from me\". According to Gian Paolo Lomazzo , Michelangelo and Raphael met once: the former was alone, while the latter was accompanied by several others. Michelangelo commented that he thought he had encountered the chief of police with such an assemblage, and Raphael replied that he thought he had met an executioner, as they are wont to walk alone. [99] Works Main articles: List of works by Michelangelo and Michelangelo Buonarroti catalogue raisonn\u00e9 Madonna and Child The Madonna of the Stairs is Michelangelo's earliest known work in marble. It is carved in shallow relief, a technique often employed by the master-sculptor of the early 15th century, Donatello, and others such as Desiderio da Settignano . [100] While the Madonna is in profile, the easiest aspect for a shallow relief, the child displays a twisting motion that was to become characteristic of Michelangelo's work. The Taddei Tondo of 1502 shows the Christ Child frightened by a Bullfinch , a symbol of the Crucifixion. [45] The lively form of the child was later adapted by Raphael in the Bridgewater Madonna . The Madonna of Bruges was, at the time of its creation, unlike other such statues depicting the Virgin proudly presenting her son. Here, the Christ Child, restrained by his mother's clasping hand, is about to step off into the world. [101] The Doni Tondo , depicting the Holy Family , has elements of all three previous works: the frieze of figures in the background has the appearance of a low-relief, while the circular shape and dynamic forms echo the Taddeo Tondo. The twisting motion present in the Madonna of Bruges is accentuated in the painting. The painting heralds the forms, movement and colour that Michelangelo was to employ on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. [45] The Madonna of the Stairs (1490\u20131492) The Taddei Tondo (1502) Madonna of Bruges (1504) The Doni Tondo (1504\u20131506) Male figure The kneeling Angel is an early work, one of several that Michelangelo created as part of a large decorative scheme for the Arca di San Domenico in the church dedicated to that saint in Bologna. Several other artists had worked on the scheme, beginning with Nicola Pisano in the 13th century. In the late 15th century, the project was managed by Niccol\u00f2 dell'Arca . An angel holding a candlestick, by Niccol\u00f2, was already in place. [102] Although the two angels form a pair, there is a great contrast between the two works, the one depicting a delicate child with flowing hair clothed in Gothic robes with deep folds, and Michelangelo's depicting a robust and muscular youth with eagle's wings, clad in a garment of Classical style. Everything about Michelangelo's Angel is dynamic. [103] Michelangelo's Bacchus was a commission with a specified subject, the youthful God of Wine . The sculpture has all the traditional attributes, a vine wreath, a cup of wine and a fawn, but Michelangelo ingested an air of reality into the subject, depicting him with bleary eyes, a swollen bladder and a stance that suggests he is unsteady on his feet. [102] While the work is plainly inspired by Classical sculpture, it is innovative for its rotating movement and strongly three-dimensional quality, which encourages the viewer to look at it from every angle. [104] In the so-called Dying Slave , Michelangelo again utilised the figure with marked contrapposto to suggest a particular human state, in this case waking from sleep. With the Rebellious Slave , it is one of two such earlier figures for the Tomb of Pope Julius II , now in the Louvre, that the sculptor brought to an almost finished state. [105] These two works were to have a profound influence on later sculpture, through Rodin who studied them at the Louvre . [106] The Atlas Slave is one of the later figures for Pope Julius' tomb. The works, known collectively as The Captives , each show the figure struggling to free itself, as if from the bonds of the rock in which it is lodged. The works give a unique insight into the sculptural methods that Michelangelo employed and his way of revealing what he perceived within the rock. [107] Angel by Michelangelo, early work (1494\u201395) Bacchus by Michelangelo, early work (1496\u20131497) Dying Slave , Louvre (1513) Atlas Slave (1530\u20131534) Sistine Chapel ceiling Main article: Sistine Chapel ceiling The Sistine Chapel ceiling was painted between 1508 and 1512. [53] The ceiling is a flattened barrel vault supported on twelve triangular pendentives that rise from between the windows of the chapel. The commission, as envisaged by Pope Julius II , was to adorn the pendentives with figures of the twelve apostles. [108] Michelangelo, who was reluctant to take the job, persuaded the Pope to give him a free hand in the composition. [109] The resultant scheme of decoration awed his contemporaries and has inspired other artists ever since. [110] The scheme is of nine panels illustrating episodes from the Book of Genesis , set in an architectonic frame. On the pendentives, Michelangelo replaced the proposed Apostles with Prophets and Sibyls who heralded the coming of the Messiah . [109] The Sistine Chapel Ceiling (1508\u20131512) Michelangelo began painting with the later episodes in the narrative, the pictures including locational details and groups of figures, the Drunkenness of Noah being the first of this group. [109] In the later compositions, painted after the initial scaffolding had been removed, Michelangelo made the figures larger. [109] One of the central images, The Creation of Adam is one of the best known and most reproduced works in the history of art. [58] The final panel, showing the Separation of Light from Darkness is the broadest in style and was painted in a single day. As the model for the Creator, Michelangelo has depicted himself in the action of painting the ceiling. [109] The Drunkenness of Noah The Deluge (detail) The Creation of Adam (1510) The First Day of Creation As supporters to the smaller scenes, Michelangelo painted twenty youths who have variously been interpreted as angels, as muses, or simply as decoration. Michelangelo referred to them as \"ignudi\". [111] The figure reproduced may be seen in context in the above image of the Separation of Light from Darkness .\nIn the process of painting the ceiling, Michelangelo made studies for different figures, of which some, such as that for The Libyan Sibyl have survived, demonstrating the care taken by Michelangelo in details such as the hands and feet. [112] The Prophet Jeremiah , contemplating the downfall of Jerusalem, is a self-portrait. Studies for The Libyan Sibyl The Libyan Sibyl (1511) The Prophet Jeremiah (1511) Ignudo Figure compositions Michelangelo's relief of the Battle of the Centaurs , created while he was still a youth associated with the Medici Academy, [113] is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle. Such a complex disarray of figures was rare in Florentine art, where it would usually only be found in images showing either the Massacre of the Innocents or the Torments of Hell. The relief treatment, in which some of the figures are boldly projecting, may indicate Michelangelo's familiarity with Roman sarcophagus reliefs from the collection of Lorenzo Medici, and similar marble panels created by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano , and with the figurative compositions on Ghiberti 's Baptistry Doors . [ citation needed ] The composition of the Battle of Cascina is known in its entirety only from copies, [114] as the original cartoon, according to Vasari, was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces. [115] It reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures, [116] with many different postures, and many being viewed from the back, as they turn towards the approaching enemy and prepare for battle. [ citation needed ] In The Last Judgment it is said that Michelangelo drew inspiration from a fresco by Melozzo da Forl\u00ec in Rome's Santi Apostoli . Melozzo had depicted figures from different angles, as if they were floating in the Heaven and seen from below. Melozzo's majestic figure of Christ, with windblown cloak, demonstrates a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by Andrea Mantegna , but was not usual in the frescos of Florentine painters. In The Last Judgment Michelangelo had the opportunity to depict, on an unprecedented scale, figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down. [ citation needed ] In the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, The Crucifixion of St. Peter and The Conversion of Saul , Michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative. In the Crucifixion of Peter soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events. A group of horrified women cluster in the foreground, while another group of Christians is led by a tall man to witness the events. In the right foreground, Michelangelo walks out of the painting with an expression of disillusionment. [ citation needed ] Battle of the Centaurs (1492) Copy of the lost Battle of Cascina by Bastiano da Sangallo The Last Judgment , detail of the Redeemed (see whole image above) The Crucifixion of St. Peter Architecture Michelangelo's architectural commissions included a number that were not realised, notably the fa\u00e7ade for Brunelleschi's Church of San Lorenzo in Florence, for which Michelangelo had a wooden model constructed, but which remains to this day unfinished rough brick. At the same church, Giulio de' Medici (later Pope Clement VII) commissioned him to design the Medici Chapel and the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo Medici. [117] Pope Clement also commissioned the Laurentian Library, for which Michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vestibule with columns recessed into niches, and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava, according to Nikolaus Pevsner , \"...\u00a0revealing Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form .\" [118] In 1546 Michelangelo produced the highly complex ovoid design for the pavement of the Campidoglio and began designing an upper storey for the Farnese Palace . In 1547 he took on the job of completing St Peter's Basilica, begun to a design by Bramante, and with several intermediate designs by several architects. Michelangelo returned to Bramante's design, retaining the basic form and concepts by simplifying and strengthening the design to create a more dynamic and unified whole. [119] Although the late 16th-century engraving depicts the dome as having a hemispherical profile, the dome of Michelangelo's model is somewhat ovoid and the final product, as completed by Giacomo della Porta , is more so. [119] The vestibule of the Laurentian Library has Mannerist features which challenge the Classical order of Brunelleschi's adjacent church. Michelangelo's redesign of the ancient Capitoline Hill included a complex spiralling pavement with a star at its centre. Michelangelo's design for St Peter's is both massive and contained, with the corners between the apsidal arms of the Greek Cross filled by square projections. The exterior is surrounded by a giant order of pilasters supporting a continuous cornice. Four small cupolas cluster around the dome. Final years In his old age, Michelangelo created a number of Piet\u00e0s in which he apparently reflects upon mortality. They are heralded by the Victory , perhaps created for the tomb of Pope Julius II but left unfinished. In this group, the youthful victor overcomes an older hooded figure, with the features of Michelangelo. The Piet\u00e0 of Vittoria Colonna is a chalk drawing of a type described as \"presentation drawings\", as they might be given as a gift by an artist, and were not necessarily studies towards a painted work. In this image, Mary's upraised arms and hands are indicative of her prophetic role. The frontal aspect is reminiscent of Masaccio 's fresco of the Holy Trinity in the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella , Florence. In the Florentine Piet\u00e0 , Michelangelo again depicts himself, this time as the aged Nicodemus lowering the body of Jesus from the cross into the arms of Mary his mother and Mary Magdalene. Michelangelo smashed the left arm and leg of the figure of Jesus. His pupil Tiberio Calcagni repaired the arm and drilled a hole in which to fix a replacement leg which was not subsequently attached. He also worked on the figure of Mary Magdalene. [120] [121] The last sculpture that Michelangelo worked on (six days before his death), the Rondanini Piet\u00e0 , could never be completed because Michelangelo carved it away until there was insufficient stone. The legs and a detached arm remain from a previous stage of the work. As it remains, the sculpture has an abstract quality, in keeping with 20th-century concepts of sculpture. [122] [123] Michelangelo died in Rome on 18 February 1564, [124] at the age of 88. His body was taken from Rome for interment at the Basilica of Santa Croce , fulfilling the maestro's last request to be buried in his beloved Florence . [125] Michelangelo's heir Lionardo Buonarroti commissioned Giorgio Vasari to design and build the Tomb of Michelangelo , a monumental project that cost 770 scudi , and took over 14 years to complete. [126] Marble for the tomb was supplied by Cosimo I de' Medici , Duke of Tuscany, who had also organized a state funeral to honour Michelangelo in Florence. [126] Self-portrait of the artist as Nicodemus Statue of Victory (1534), Palazzo Vecchio, Florence The Piet\u00e0 of Vittoria Colonna (c. 1540) The Rondanini Piet\u00e0 (1552\u20131564) Legacy Tomb of Michelangelo (1578) by Giorgio Vasari in Santa Croce , Florence Michelangelo, with Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael, is one of the three giants of the Florentine High Renaissance . Although their names are often cited together, Michelangelo was younger than Leonardo by 23 years, and older than Raphael by eight. Because of his reclusive nature, he had little to do with either artist and outlived both of them by more than forty years. [ citation needed ] Michelangelo took few sculpture students. He employed Francesco Granacci , who was his fellow pupil at the Medici Academy, and became one of several assistants on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. [56] Michelangelo appears to have used assistants mainly for the more manual tasks of preparing surfaces and grinding colours. Despite this, his works were to have a great influence on painters, sculptors and architects for many generations to come. While Michelangelo's David is the most famous male nude of all time, and copies of it now grace cities around the world, some of his other works have had perhaps even greater impact on the course of art. The twisting forms and tensions of the Victory , the Bruges Madonna and the Medici Madonna make them the heralds of the Mannerist art . The unfinished giants for the tomb of Pope Julius II had profound effect on late-19th- and 20th-century sculptors such as Rodin and Henry Moore . Michelangelo's vestibule of the Laurentian Library was one of the earliest buildings to use classical forms in a plastic and expressive manner. This dynamic quality was later to find its major expression in his centrally planned St. Peter's, with its giant order , its rippling cornice and its upward-launching pointed dome. The dome of St. Peter's was to influence the building of churches for many centuries, including Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome and St Paul's Cathedral , London, as well as the civic domes of many public buildings and the state capitals across America. Artists who were directly influenced by Michelangelo include Raphael, whose monumental treatment of the figure in the School of Athens and The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple owes much to Michelangelo, and whose fresco of Isaiah in Sant'Agostino closely imitates the older master's prophets. [127] Other artists, such as Pontormo , drew on the writhing forms of the Last Judgment and the frescoes of the Cappella Paolina. [128] The Sistine Chapel ceiling was a work of unprecedented grandeur, both for its architectonic forms, to be imitated by many Baroque ceiling painters, and also for the wealth of its inventiveness in the study of figures. Vasari wrote: The work has proved a veritable beacon to our art, of inestimable benefit to all painters, restoring light to a world that for centuries had been plunged into darkness. Indeed, painters no longer need to seek for new inventions, novel attitudes, clothed figures, fresh ways of expression, different arrangements, or sublime subjects, for this work contains every perfection possible under those headings.

However, in the Roman manner, ab Nativitate , it is 1475. b. ^ Sources disagree as to how old Michelangelo was when he departed for school. De Tolnay writes that it was at ten years old while Sedgwick notes in her translation of Condivi that Michelangelo was seven. c. ^ The Strozzi family acquired the sculpture Hercules . Filippo Strozzi sold it to Francis I in 1529. In 1594, Henry IV installed it in the Jardin d'Estang at Fontainebleau where it disappeared in 1713 when the Jardin d'Estange was destroyed. d. ^ Vasari makes no mention of this episode and Paolo Giovio 's Life of Michelangelo indicates that Michelangelo tried to pass the statue off as an antique himself.

For one thing, it was acted out through poems and images that were far from secret. Even if we do not choose to believe Michelangelo's protestations of the chastity of his behaviour, Tommaso's high social position and the relatively public nature of their relationship make it improbable that it was not platonic.\" ^ a b c Hughes, Anthony: \"Michelangelo\", p. 326.

The frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (1508\u201312) in the Vatican , which include the iconic depiction of the creation of Adam interpreted from Genesis , are probably the best known of Michelangelo\u2019s works today, but the artist thought of himself primarily as a sculptor. His famed sculptures include the David (1501), now in the Accademia in Florence, and the Piet\u00e0 (1499), now in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City. Read more below: The middle years: The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel Piet\u00e0 Find out about the Piet\u00e0, a popular theme in Christian art. Why is Michelangelo so famous? Michelangelo first gained notice in his 20s for his sculptures of the Piet\u00e0 (1499) and David (1501) and cemented his fame with the ceiling frescoes of the Sistine Chapel (1508\u201312). He was celebrated for his art\u2019s complexity, physical realism, psychological tension, and thoughtful consideration of space, light, and shadow. Many writers have commented on his ability to turn stone into flesh and to imbue his painted figures with energy. Michelangelo\u2019s talent continued to be recognized in subsequent centuries, and thus his fame has endured into the 21st century. Read more below: The middle years: The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel David Read more about Michelangelo\u2019s statue of David. How did Michelangelo paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel? Michelangelo painted the frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel not lying down as sometimes described but standing on an extensive scaffold, reaching up and craning his neck. Because he had never worked in fresco before, Michelangelo and his assistants worked from hundreds of his sketches to transfer outlines onto a freshly plastered surface. Once he became comfortable with the medium, however, he abandoned the sketches. To add colour, Michelangelo used the buon fresco technique, in which the artist paints quickly on wet plaster before it dries. Some scholars believe that for detailed work, such as a figure\u2019s face, Michelangelo probably used the fresco secco technique, in which the artist paints on a dry plaster surface.

The Restoration of the Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel Learn about the restoration of Michelangelo\u2019s painting in the Sistine Chapel. What was Michelangelo like as a person? Many writers have described Michelangelo as the archetype of a brooding and difficult artist, and, although he was indeed hot-tempered, his character was much more complex than the sullen artist stereotype. He was also deeply religious and could be very generous toward his assistants. There has been some speculation that Michelangelo might have been gay, but scholars cannot confirm his sexual preference. He led a mostly solitary life with few known intimate relationships. What makes Michelangelo a Renaissance man? The Renaissance man is an ideal that developed in Renaissance Italy from one of its most-accomplished representatives, Leon Battista Alberti , who stated that \u201ca man can do all things if he will.\u201d This led to the notion that men should try to embrace all knowledge and develop their own capacities as fully as possible, and thus gifted men of the Renaissance sought to develop skills in all areas of knowledge, in physical development, in social accomplishments, and in the arts. Michelangelo exemplified the ideal through his accomplishments in sculpture , painting , architecture , and poetry . Renaissance man Learn more about the concept of a Renaissance man.

Summarize This Article Michelangelo (born March 6, 1475, Caprese, Republic of Florence [Italy]\u2014died February 18, 1564, Rome , Papal States) was an Italian Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect, and poet who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Michelangelo's The Last Judgment , explained Pope Clement VII commissioned Michelangelo to paint a fresco in the Sistine Chapel in 1534. (more) See all videos for this article Michelangelo was considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime, and ever since then he has been held to be one of the greatest artists of all time. A number of his works in painting , sculpture , and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. Although the frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (Vatican; see below ) are probably the best known of his works, the artist thought of himself primarily as a sculptor. His practice of several arts, however, was not unusual in his time, when all of them were thought of as based on design, or drawing . Michelangelo worked in marble sculpture all his life and in the other arts only during certain periods. The high regard for the Sistine ceiling is partly a reflection of the greater attention paid to painting in the 20th century and partly, too, because many of the artist\u2019s works in other media remain unfinished. Michelangelo: detail of a Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco Detail of a ceiling fresco by Michelangelo, 1508\u201312; in the Sistine Chapel, Vatican City. (more) A side effect of Michelangelo\u2019s fame in his lifetime was that his career was more fully documented than that of any artist of the time or earlier. He was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive\u2014in fact, there were two rival biographies. The first was the final chapter in the series of artists\u2019 lives (1550) by the painter and architect Giorgio Vasari . It was the only chapter on a living artist and explicitly presented Michelangelo\u2019s works as the culminating perfection of art, surpassing the efforts of all those before him. Despite such an encomium, Michelangelo was not entirely pleased and arranged for his assistant Ascanio Condivi to write a brief separate book (1553); probably based on the artist\u2019s own spoken comments, this account shows him as he wished to appear. After Michelangelo\u2019s death, Vasari in a second edition (1568) offered a rebuttal. While scholars have often preferred the authority of Condivi, Vasari\u2019s lively writing, the importance of his book as a whole, and its frequent reprinting in many languages have made it the most usual basis of popular ideas on Michelangelo and other Renaissance artists. Michelangelo\u2019s fame also led to the preservation of countless mementos, including hundreds of letters, sketches, and poems, again more than of any contemporary. Yet despite the enormous benefit that has accrued from all this, in controversial matters often only Michelangelo\u2019s side of an argument is known. Early life and works Michelangelo Buonarroti was born to a family that had for several generations belonged to minor nobility in Florence but had, by the time the artist was born, lost its patrimony and status. His father had only occasional government jobs, and at the time of Michelangelo\u2019s birth he was administrator of the small dependent town of Caprese. A few months later, however, the family returned to its permanent residence in Florence. It was something of a downward social step to become an artist, and Michelangelo became an apprentice relatively late, at 13, perhaps after overcoming his father\u2019s objections. He was apprenticed to the city\u2019s most prominent painter, Domenico Ghirlandaio , for a three-year term, but he left after one year, having (Condivi recounts) nothing more to learn. Several drawings, copies of figures by Ghirlandaio and older great painters of Florence, Giotto and Masaccio , survive from this stage; such copying was standard for apprentices, but few examples are known to survive. Obviously talented, he was taken under the wing of the ruler of the city, Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici , known as the Magnificent. Lorenzo surrounded himself with poets and intellectuals , and Michelangelo was included. More important, he had access to the Medici art collection , which was dominated by fragments of ancient Roman statuary. (Lorenzo was not such a patron of contemporary art as legend has made him; such modern art as he owned was to ornament his house or to make political statements.) The bronze sculptor Bertoldo di Giovanni , a Medici friend who was in charge of the collection, was the nearest he had to a teacher of sculpture, but Michelangelo did not follow his medium or in any major way his approach. Still, one of the two marble works that survive from the artist\u2019s first years is a variation on the composition of an ancient Roman sarcophagus , and Bertoldo had produced a similar one in bronze. This composition is the Battle of the Centaurs (c. 1492). The action and power of the figures foretell the artist\u2019s later interests much more than does the Madonna of the Stairs (c. 1491), a delicate low relief that reflects recent fashions among such Florentine sculptors as Desiderio da Settignano . Britannica Quiz Artists, Painters, & Architects Florence was at this time regarded as the leading centre of art, producing the best painters and sculptors in Europe, and the competition among artists was stimulating . The city was, however, less able than earlier to offer large commissions, and leading Florentine-born artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Leonardo\u2019s teacher, Andrea del Verrocchio , had moved away for better opportunities in other cities. The Medici were overthrown in 1494, and even before the end of the political turmoil Michelangelo had left. In Bologna he was hired to succeed a recently deceased sculptor and carve the last small figures required to complete a grand project, the tomb and shrine of St. Dominic (1494\u201395). The three marble figures are original and expressive. Departing from his predecessor\u2019s fanciful agility, he imposed seriousness on his images by a compactness of form that owed much to Classical antiquity and to the Florentine tradition from Giotto onward. This emphasis on seriousness is also reflected in his choice of marble as his medium, while the accompanying simplification of masses is in contrast to the then more usual tendency to let representations match as completely as possible the texture and detail of human bodies. To be sure, although these are constant qualities in Michelangelo\u2019s art, they often are temporarily abandoned or modified because of other factors, such as the specific functions of works or the stimulating creations of other artists. This is the case with Michelangelo\u2019s first surviving large statue, the Bacchus , produced in Rome (1496\u201397) following a brief return to Florence. (A wooden crucifix, recently discovered, attributed by some scholars to Michelangelo and now housed in the Casa Buonarroti in Florence, has also been proposed as the antecedent of the Bacchus in design by those who credit it as the artist\u2019s work.) The Bacchus relies on ancient Roman nude figures as a point of departure, but it is much more mobile and more complex in outline. The conscious instability evokes the god of wine and Dionysian revels with extraordinary virtuosity. Made for a garden, it is also unique among Michelangelo\u2019s works in calling for observation from all sides rather than primarily from the front.

The name refers not (as is often presumed) to this specific work but to a common traditional type of devotional image, this work being today the most famous example. Extracted from narrative scenes of the lamentation after Christ\u2019s death, the concentrated group of two is designed to evoke the observer\u2019s repentant prayers for sins that required Christ\u2019s sacrificial death. The patron was a French cardinal, and the type was earlier more common in northern Europe than in Italy . The complex problem for the designer was to extract two figures from one marble block, an unusual undertaking in all periods. Michelangelo treated the group as one dense and compact mass as before so that it has an imposing impact, yet he underlined the many contrasts present\u2014of male and female, vertical and horizontal, clothed and naked, dead and alive\u2014to clarify the two components.

(more) See all videos for this article The artist\u2019s prominence, established by this work, was reinforced at once by the commission (1501) of the David for the cathedral of Florence. For this huge statue, an exceptionally large commission in that city, Michelangelo reused a block left unfinished about 40 years before. The modeling is especially close to the formulas of classical antiquity, with a simplified geometry suitable to the huge scale yet with a mild assertion of organic life in its asymmetry. It has continued to serve as the prime statement of the Renaissance ideal of perfect humanity. Although the sculpture was originally intended for the buttress of the cathedral, the magnificence of the finished work convinced Michelangelo\u2019s contemporaries to install it in a more prominent place, to be determined by a commission formed of artists and prominent citizens. They decided that the David would be installed in front of the entrance of the Palazzo dei Priori (now called Palazzo Vecchio) as a symbol of the Florentine Republic. It was later replaced by a copy, and the original was moved to the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia . On the side Michelangelo produced in the same years (1501\u201304) several Madonnas for private houses, the staple of artists\u2019 work at the time. These include one small statue, two circular reliefs that are similar to paintings in suggesting varied levels of spatial depth, and the artist\u2019s only easel painting . While the statue ( Madonna and Child ) is blocky and immobile, the painting ( Holy Family ) and one of the reliefs ( Madonna and Child with the Infant St. John ) are full of motion; they show arms and legs of figures interweaving in actions that imply movement through time. The forms carry symbolic references to Christ\u2019s future death, common in images of the Christ Child at the time; they also betray the artist\u2019s fascination with the work of Leonardo . Michelangelo regularly denied that anyone influenced him, and his statements have usually been accepted without demur. But Leonardo\u2019s return to Florence in 1500 after nearly 20 years was exciting to younger artists there, and later scholars generally agreed that Michelangelo was among those affected. Leonardo\u2019s works were probably the most powerful and lasting outside influence to modify Michelangelo\u2019s work, and he was able to blend Leonardo\u2019s ability to show momentary processes with his own to suggest weight and strength, without losing any of the latter quality. The resulting images, of massive bodies in forceful action, are those special creations that constitute the larger part of his most admired major works. viewers observing Michelangelo's The Holy Family Viewers observing The Holy Family , tempera on wood, by Michelangelo, 1506/08; in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.

Its spiraling composition and cold, brilliant colour scheme underline the sculptural intensity of the figures and create a dynamic and expressive effect. The iconographic interpretation has caused countless scholarly debates, which to the present day have not been entirely resolved."

His work demonstrated a blend of psychological insight, physical realism and intensity never before seen. His contemporaries recognized his extraordinary talent, and Michelangelo received commissions from some of the most wealthy and powerful men of his day, including popes and others affiliated with the Catholic Church. His resulting work, most notably his Piet\u00e0 and David sculptures and his Sistine Chapel paintings, has been carefully tended and preserved, ensuring that future generations would be able to view and appreciate Michelangelo\u2019s genius. Early Life and Training Michelangelo Buonarroti (Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni) was born on March 6, 1475, in Caprese, Italy. His father worked for the Florentine government, and shortly after his birth his family returned to Florence, the city Michelangelo would always consider his true home. Did you know? Michelangelo received the commission to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling as a consolation prize of sorts when Pope Julius II temporarily scaled back plans for a massive sculpted memorial to himself that Michelangelo was to complete. Florence during the Italian Renaissance period was a vibrant arts center, an opportune locale for Michelangelo\u2019s innate talents to develop and flourish. His mother died when he was 6, and initially his father initially did not approve of his son\u2019s interest in art as a career. At 13, Michelangelo was apprenticed to painter Domenico Ghirlandaio, particularly known for his murals. A year later, his talent drew the attention of Florence\u2019s leading citizen and art patron, Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici , who enjoyed the intellectual stimulation of being surrounded by the city\u2019s most literate, poetic and talented men. He extended an invitation to Michelangelo to reside in a room of his palatial home. Michelangelo learned from and was inspired by the scholars and writers in Lorenzo\u2019s intellectual circle, and his later work would forever be informed by what he learned about philosophy and politics in those years. While staying in the Medici home, he also refined his technique under the tutelage of Bertoldo di Giovanni, keeper of Lorenzo\u2019s collection of ancient Roman sculptures and a noted sculptor himself. Although Michelangelo expressed his genius in many media, he would always consider himself a sculptor first. Sculptures: The Pieta and David Michelangelo was working in Rome by 1498 when he received a career-making commission from the visiting French cardinal Jean Bilh\u00e8res de Lagraulas, envoy of King Charles VIII to the pope. The cardinal wanted to create a substantial statue depicting a draped Virgin Mary with her dead son resting in her arms\u2014a Pieta\u2014to grace his own future tomb. Michelangelo\u2019s delicate 69-inch-tall masterpiece featuring two intricate figures carved from one block of marble continues to draw legions of visitors to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica more than 500 years after its completion. Michelangelo returned to Florence and in 1501 was contracted to create, again from marble, a huge male figure to enhance the city\u2019s famous Duomo, officially the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. He chose to depict the young David from the Old Testament of the Bible as heroic, energetic, powerful and spiritual and literally larger than life at 17 feet tall. The sculpture, considered by scholars to be nearly technically perfect, remains in Florence at the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia , where it is a world-renowned symbol of the city and its artistic heritage. Paintings: Sistine Chapel In 1505, Pope Julius II commissioned Michelangelo to sculpt a grand tomb with 40 life-size statues, and the artist began work. But the pope\u2019s priorities shifted away from the project as he became embroiled in military disputes and his funds became scarce, and a displeased Michelangelo left Rome (although he continued to work on the tomb, off and on, for decades). However, in 1508, Julius called Michelangelo back to Rome for a less expensive, but still ambitious painting project: to depict the 12 apostles on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , a most sacred part of the Vatican where new popes are elected and inaugurated. Instead, over the course of the four-year project, Michelangelo painted 12 figures\u2014seven prophets and five sibyls (female prophets of myth)\u2014around the border of the ceiling and filled the central space with scenes from Genesis. Critics suggest that the way Michelangelo depicts the prophet Ezekiel\u2014as strong yet stressed, determined yet unsure\u2014is symbolic of Michelangelo\u2019s sensitivity to the intrinsic complexity of the human condition. The most famous Sistine Chapel ceiling painting is the emotion-infused The Creation of Adam, in which God and Adam outstretch their hands to one another. Architecture & Poems The quintessential Renaissance man, Michelangelo continued to sculpt and paint until his death, although he increasingly worked on architectural projects as he aged: His work from 1520 to 1527 on the interior of the Medici Chapel in Florence included wall designs, windows and cornices that were unusual in their design and introduced startling variations on classical forms. Michelangelo also designed the iconic dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome (although its completion came after his death). Among his other masterpieces are Moses (sculpture, completed 1515); The Last Judgment (painting, completed 1534); and Day, Night, Dawn and Dusk (sculptures, all completed by 1533). Later Years From the 1530s on, Michelangelo wrote poems; about 300 survive. Many incorporate the philosophy of Neo-Platonism\u2014that a human soul, powered by love and ecstasy, can reunite with an almighty God\u2014ideas that had been the subject of intense discussion while he was an adolescent living in Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u2019s household. After he left Florence permanently in 1534 for Rome, Michelangelo also wrote many lyrical letters to his family members who remained there. The theme of many was his strong attachment to various young men, especially aristocrat Tommaso Cavalieri. Scholars debate whether this was more an expression of homosexuality or a bittersweet longing by the unmarried, childless, aging Michelangelo for a father-son relationship. Michelangelo died at age 88 after a short illness in 1564, surviving far past the usual life expectancy of the era. A pieta he had begun sculpting in the late 1540s, intended for his own tomb, remained unfinished but is on display at the Museo dell\u2019Opera del Duomo in Florence\u2014not very far from where Michelangelo is buried, at the Basilica di Santa Croce .

By Asher Fogle Published: Nov 10, 2015 Save Article Media Platforms Design Team In 1865, Lewis Carroll self-published his manuscript of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . To celebrate its 150th birthday, we've gone down the rabbit hole to find some fun facts about this beloved children's classic. 1 Alice was a real girl. Media Platforms Design Team She was the daughter of Carroll's boss: Henry Liddell, the dean of Christ Church College at Oxford, where Carroll taught mathematics. 2 Her siblings inspired the story, too. Media Platforms Design Team Carroll formed a friendship with Henry Liddell, his wife Lorina, and their entire family. (He took this photograph of Alice, Ina, Harry, and Edith Liddell in the summer of 1860.) The little sisters in the Doormouse's story \u2014 Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie \u2014 are references to their three daughters. Lorina Charlotte's initials became Elsie, Lacie is an anagram of Alice, and Tillie was short for Matilda, a nickname given to Edith. 3 It was almost \"Alice in Elf Land.\" Media Platforms Design Team It was originally titled Alice's Adventures Under Ground when he gave a handwritten copy to Alice Liddell. By the time it was published, the name had been changed to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . But he went through other titles along the way, including Alice's Hour in Elf Land , Alice Among the Fairies , and Alice Among the Goblins .

Media Platforms Design Team On a boating trip up the Thames in the summer of 1862, Carroll spun a fantastic tale for Alice Liddell and her sisters. But after that, the kids pestered him to retell the story \u2014 Carroll even wrote in his diary about telling \"the interminable Alice's adventures.\" So he eventually wrote the story down and gave it to Alice for Christmas 1864. (The original was half as long as the version later published and didn't include scenes like the Mad Hatter or Cheshire Cat.) 5 Carroll based the Dodo bird on himself. Media Platforms Design Team At least according to legend: In the book, Carroll alludes to the pivotal boat trip by putting the participants into the story as birds. He was the Dodo, named after his real last name, Dodgson. The author had a documented tendency to stammer, and the story is that he would introduce himself as \"Do-do-dogson.\" 6 Carroll saw things the way Alice did. Media Platforms Design Team In addition to partial deafness and other health complications, Carroll suffered from a rare neurological disorder that causes hallucinations and makes objects appear larger or smaller than they are. The disease wasn't discovered  until 1955 by English psychiatrist John Todd. Eventually, it was named Alice in Wonderland Syndrome or Todd's Syndrome.

Media Platforms Design Team In the garden behind the Liddell home at Christ Church College, Oxford, stands a tree that is said to have inspired the famous feline's perch. 8 The author's name wasn't Lewis Carroll. Media Platforms Design Team Charles Lutwidge Dodgson started using the pen name in 1856 when he published a romantic poem. It was a play on a Latin translation of his real first and middle names. Other options he gave the editor to choose from: Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll. 9 It was first made into a movie in 1903. View full post on Youtube Directors Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stowe made the story into a 12-minute film, which made it the longest film produced in Britain at the time. Since then, it's inspired more than 50 TV or film adaptations and sequels.

The phrase, used to describe how hat makers often got dementia from the mercury used in curing felt, had been around since the early 1800s. But Carroll, a marketing genius, popularized \u2014 and licensed it. Alice and her friend adorned cookie tins and postage stamp cases. He was the first children's book author to license characters, so his Mad Hatter took on a life of his own. 11 ... and \"I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date!\" Media Platforms Design Team Other notables: \"Tweedledee and Tweedledum,\" \"Cheshire Cat grin,\" and \"down the rabbit hole.\" 12 Queen Victoria was a fan. Media Platforms Design Team After reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland , Queen Victoria suggested that Carroll dedicate his next work to her. She probably should have been more specific: Carroll was a mathematician, so his next work was An Elementary Treatise on Determinants, With Their Application to Simultaneous Linear Equations and Algebraic Equations . He presented it to the Queen. One can only imagine her reaction... Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 13 They've been banned before. Media Platforms Design Team Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the sequel, Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There , were both banned in China in 1931. Why? On the grounds that \"animals should not use human language.\" Go figure. 14 The book has never been out of print. Media Platforms Design Team Since it was published in 1865, it has been translated into 176 languages. At the time, the book was so popular that its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There , sold out within seven weeks of its publication. Asher Fogle Writer When she\u2019s not hunting for compelling personal stories or justifying her love for dessert, Asher can likely be found watching early-2000s TV on Netflix with her husband. She believes that turquoise pots create tastier meals, iced coffee and power tools make her unstoppable, and one can never have too many books.
