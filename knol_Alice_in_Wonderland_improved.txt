2. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
2.1. Plot Overview
• In the opening scene, young Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole into an enchanting world known as Wonderland. The story unfolds through her encounters with various peculiar characters and events that challenge her understanding of reality and herself.
• As she navigates this strange land, Alice experiences bizarre situations, such as shrinking in size or growing to enormous proportions, which serve as metaphors for the unpredictable nature of childhood and personal growth.
• The narrative follows a nonlinear structure, with time shifting between different moments in Wonderland's timeline. This approach reflects Alice's disoriented state of mind and emphasizes the fluidity of her experiences within this fantastical realm.

2.2. Main Characters and Their Significance
• The White Rabbit: A symbolic representation of curiosity, as his constant presence leads Alice to venture into Wonderland. His pocket watch also serves as a metaphor for the passage of time in the story's nonlinear narrative structure.
• The Cheshire Cat: An enigmatic character who appears and disappears at will, representing the elusive nature of truth and reality within Alice's journey. He provides cryptic advice to Alice throughout her adventures, challenging her perceptions and encouraging self-reflection.
• The Queen of Hearts: A tyrannical ruler who embodies irrationality and authoritarianism. Her obsession with playing croquet using flamingos as mallets symbolizes the arbitrary nature of power and control, while her infamous line "Off with their heads!" reflects Carroll's critique of oppressive social structures.
• Tweedledum and Tweedledee: Identical twin brothers who engage in a nonsensical argument about which one is larger. Their absurdity serves as an allegory for the arbitrary nature of societal norms, particularly those related to gender roles during Carroll's time.
• The Mad Hatter and March Hare: Characters from the infamous tea party scene in Wonderland, they represent eccentric individuals who challenge conventional behavior through their nonsensical conversation and antics. Their interaction with Alice highlights her struggle to make sense of a world that defies logic and reason.

2.3. Literary Devices Used by Lewis Carroll
• Nonsense verse: The story is filled with whimsical poetry, such as the famous "Jabberwocky," which creates an imaginative atmosphere while challenging readers' understanding of language and meaning.
• Paradoxes and contradictions: Characters often speak in paradoxical statements that defy logic, such as Tweedledum's claim to be larger than his brother despite their identical appearance. These instances challenge the reader's perception of reality within Wonderland.
• Anthropomorphism: Animals and objects are given human-like qualities throughout the story, allowing Carroll to explore complex themes through whimsical characters like the White Rabbit or the Cheshire Cat. This technique also serves as a commentary on Victorian society's fascination with anthropomorphic representations of animals in art and literature.
• Satire: Alice in Wonderland satirizes various aspects of Victorian society, including its social norms, educational practices, and gender roles. Carroll uses humor and absurdity to critique these institutions while simultaneously celebrating the imagination and creativity that children possess.
• Allegory: The story can be interpreted as an allegorical representation of childhood and personal growth, with Wonderland serving as a metapayer for Alice's journey through life. Various characters symbolize different aspects of this process, such as curiosity (the White Rabbit), self-reflection (the Cheshire Cat), or the struggle to find one's place in society (Alice herself).
