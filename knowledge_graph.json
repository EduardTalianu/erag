There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after",

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;",

Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of",

I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.

Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!\u201d Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to",

Which way?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way!

Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,",

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance. \u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d only been the",

Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \u201cI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it was in March.\u201d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. \u201cDid you say pig, or fig?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI said pig,\u201d",

A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u201cVery uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u201cNo room!

This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. \u201cAt any rate I\u2019ll never go _there_ again!\u201d said Alice as she picked her way",

CHAPTER VIII. The Queen\u2019s Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five!

So she went in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle\u2019s Story \u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201d said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s, and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. \u201cWhen _I\u2019m_ a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.
